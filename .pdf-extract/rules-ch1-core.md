---

## Dice (p.16)

Cortex Prime uses five die types: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12. Every trait in the game has a die rating corresponding to one of these sizes. When a trait is included in a roll, the player picks up a die of that size and adds it to the dice pool.

### Die Ratings and Stepping (p.16)

**Stepping up** a die by one means swapping it for the next larger die (d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 -> d12). **Stepping down** means swapping it for the next smaller die. Stepping down a d4 removes the die entirely. A d12 can only be stepped up in specific circumstances (such as taking out a character); if a rule or SFX steps an effect die beyond d12, the result is either an automatic takeout/victory, or another die from the pool becomes a second effect die (p.21).

Stepping can occur by more than one step at a time (e.g., stepping up by 2 means d4 -> d8).

### The Dice Pool (p.17)

When rolling for a test or contest, the player assembles a dice pool from relevant trait sets on their character file, plus any bonus dice. There is no maximum number of dice in a pool; typical pools range from three to eight dice. The GM assembles an opposition pool based on what the character faces.

### Rolling Dice (p.17)

When rolling two or more dice, the player **chooses two results to add together for a total**, and then **chooses a third die as the effect die**. The player is free to choose any two dice for the total; they need not be the two highest results. If rolling only one die, the total equals that single result. If no third die remains for the effect die, the effect die defaults to d4.

All rolls are made in the open.

### Hitches and Botches (p.17)

Any die that rolls a 1 is a **hitch**. It cannot count toward the total and cannot be used as the effect die. Hitches are set aside; the GM has the option to activate them (see Complications). When the GM rolls a 1, it is called an **opportunity**, which players can activate.

If **all dice** come up as 1, that is a **botch**. The total is effectively zero. A botch is categorically bad; the GM can create a complication without handing over a plot point, stepped up once for each hitch past the first.

Dice that have been rerolled (via game mechanics) can be used to reroll hitches, provided those hitches have not already been spent on another game effect.

### SFX (p.17)

SFX are exception-based features on characters that alter dice pools, results, or the story. They typically have an activating condition, a cost or drawback, and a benefit. Detailed in Chapter 3 (p.61).

---

## Tests and Contests (pp.18-23)

### Tests: Success or Failure (p.18)

A **test** is initiated by the GM asking the player to roll. The GM assembles an opposition pool and rolls first, adding two dice together to set the **difficulty**. The player then rolls their dice pool and tries to **beat** the difficulty total. Beating means rolling strictly higher; tying the difficulty counts as failure.

The opposition pool for a test starts with two difficulty dice of the same size, based on situation severity:

| Difficulty | Dice |
|---|---|
| Very Easy | d4 d4 |
| Easy | d6 d6 |
| Challenging | d8 d8 |
| Hard | d10 d10 |
| Very Hard | d12 d12 |

The GM may add additional dice to the opposition pool based on GMC traits, location traits, or scene traits. When in doubt, add one or more d6s for increasing risk.

A player can always choose not to respond to a test and find another way forward.

### Contests: The Struggle (pp.19-20)

A **contest** is initiated by a player, who rolls first. If the opposition declines to oppose after seeing the roll, the initiating player automatically succeeds. If the opposition rolls and **beats** the initiator's total, the ball returns to the initiator. The initiator may **give in** (defining the failure on their own terms, receiving a plot point, but unable to immediately re-initiate a contest against the same opponent) or must roll again against the new difficulty.

Contests go back and forth until one side gives in or fails to beat the difficulty. The loser takes a complication. In a high stakes scene, the loser may be taken out of the scene entirely (see Effect Dice in Opposition).

Giving in during a contest (after having rolled at least once) earns a plot point. Choosing not to oppose a contest at all does not earn a plot point.

### Heroic Success (p.20)

If you beat the difficulty by 5 or more, it is a **heroic success**. The effect die is stepped up by one for every 5 points by which you beat the difficulty. (Beat by 10 = effect die stepped up twice, etc.)

Some SFX trigger on heroic success.

### Effect Dice (pp.20-21)

The effect die is chosen from the remaining dice in the pool after the two total dice are selected. Only the die size matters; the rolled result on the effect die is irrelevant. The effect die determines the size of assets, complications, or stress created by the roll.

**Ineligible dice for effect:** A die that rolled a 1 (hitch) cannot be an effect die. Dice added to the total via plot points cannot also serve as effect dice. If no eligible dice remain, the effect die defaults to d4.

If a rule or SFX steps the effect die beyond d12, either the effect is an automatic takeout/victory, or another die from the pool becomes a second effect die. Players can spend a plot point to keep an extra effect die (chosen from remaining dice, or d4 if none remain). If an SFX steps up/down an effect die and you have multiple effect dice, only one is modified per SFX.

**Automatic outcomes:** When a test or contest is uncontested and an effect die is needed, use the largest die in the opposition pool (for a test) or the initiating dice pool (for a contest).

### Effect Dice in Opposition / Contests (pp.21-22)

In **high stakes scenes**, the winner compares their effect die to the loser's effect die. If the winner's effect die is **strictly larger** than the loser's, the loser is **taken out** of the scene. If the loser's effect die is equal to or larger than the winner's, or the loser spends a plot point, they take a complication equal to the winner's effect die instead.

In **non-high-stakes** scenes (standard contests), the loser takes a complication equal to the winner's effect die. However, if the loser's effect die is **equal to or larger** than the winner's, the winner's effect die is **stepped down by one** before being applied as a complication.

### Being Taken Out (pp.22)

When taken out, a character may no longer perform tests or contests and does not participate further in the scene. A complication stepped up beyond d12 automatically takes a character out.

A character taken out can potentially be returned by other characters in the scene (healing, magic, changing circumstances). If they return, they come back with at least a d6 complication reflecting the trauma.

### Interfering in a Contest (p.23)

Costs a plot point. After each side in a contest has rolled at least once, a third character can spend a PP, describe their interference, and roll. If they fail to beat the current total, the winner gives them a complication (or stress). If they beat the total, the contest is halted; no one gives in and no one takes complications yet.

If both original sides wish to continue, each hands a plot point to the interfering player and rolls again. Neither can give in until both have rolled again. The interferer may interfere again (costing another PP), but risks taking a complication from each contestant who rolls higher.

### Contests with More Than Two Characters (p.23)

One player initiates; other characters can join one at a time (order determined by GM). The highest roller succeeds. After the first roll, any character that stays in and fails to beat the total takes a complication. They may give in as normal.

---

## Test and Contest Mods (pp.24-25)

### Action-Based Resolution (p.24)

Tests and contests are replaced by a unified **action/reaction** system. A character declares an action, gathers a pool, and rolls. The target opposes with a **reaction** (their own roll) or the GM sets difficulty dice. If the reaction beats the action's total, the action fails. Ties go to the acting character (the reaction must **exceed** the action's total for failure). Uses an action order system (p.98).

### Add All the Dice (p.25)

All dice in the pool are added together for the total (both player and opposition). Hitches still apply (any 1 is excluded from total and counts as a hitch). No effect die is available with this mod; use either No Effect Dice or Reroll for Effect. Assets and complications become much more powerful.

### No Effect Dice (p.25)

Effect dice are dropped entirely. Tests and contests have simple pass/fail outcomes. Whenever an asset or complication would be generated, assign d6 (stepped up on heroic successes). In high stakes scenes, opponents are taken out unless they spend a PP. In non-high-stakes, opponents take d6 complications (or existing complications stepped up by one).

### Reroll for Effect (p.25)

The original roll does not generate the effect die. Instead, the player or GM rerolls their entire original dice pool and takes the highest rolling die as the effect die. SFX that modify effect dice apply to this new roll. If dice in the pool were altered/stepped up after the original roll, those modifications do not carry over to the reroll.

### Static Difficulty (p.25)

Tests use a fixed target number instead of rolling difficulty dice:

| Difficulty | Target Number |
|---|---|
| Very Easy | 3 |
| Easy | 7 |
| Challenging | 11 |
| Hard | 15 |
| Very Hard | 19 |

If the PC has a complication that would add to opposition, the complication die is rolled and added to the static difficulty. GMs still roll dice for GMCs as normal.

---

## Traits (p.26)

Each trait has a die rating (d4 through d12). When a trait applies, it contributes its die to the dice pool. Trait types include (but are not limited to): attributes, distinctions, skills, affiliations, relationships, powers, roles, values.

### Trait Sets (p.26)

Traits of the same type form a **trait set**. The core rule is: you may only include **one trait from any given trait set** in a dice pool without extra cost. Including a second trait from the same set costs a plot point. Some games may restrict this PP-spend to specific trait sets.

Every game needs at least **two prime sets** plus distinctions. Prime sets are the mandatory source of dice for every test/contest (e.g., attributes + skills means every roll must include one attribute and one skill).

### Distinctions: The Universal Trait Set (p.26)

Every Cortex Prime game includes distinctions. Each character has three distinctions, broad enough that at least one can narratively fit into almost any dice pool. Distinctions are rated at d8 by default. Every distinction has a built-in **Hinder SFX**: the player may choose to roll the distinction as a d4 instead of d8, earning a plot point.

### Temporary Traits (p.26)

Temporary traits last for a scene or a session. Assets and complications are the most common examples.

---

## Plot Points (pp.27-29)

### Starting Plot Points (p.27)

Every player starts each session with at least 1 PP. Unspent PPs carry over between sessions.

### The GM and Plot Points (p.27)

The GM has two pools of PPs (unless mods change this):

**The Bank:** At session start, the GM gets 1 PP per player. This bank is shared by all GMCs. Bank PPs are used for: keeping GMCs from being taken out, activating GMC SFX, and other GMC-related uses. When the GM spends from the bank, the PP goes to the central pile (not to an affected player). The GM can add to the bank by activating GMC SFX (including using a GMC's distinction as d4 instead of d8).

**The Pile:** An unlimited supply of PPs. The GM uses this to hand PPs to players when activating hitches for complications or when SFX call for it. When players or the GM spend PPs, they return to the pile.

### Earning Plot Points as a Player (p.28)

PPs earned from a die roll cannot be spent until that roll is fully resolved.

**Complications from hitches:** The GM hands over a PP from the pile to create a d6 complication when a player rolls a hitch. Additional hitches in the same roll step up the complication without additional PP cost. The GM may instead create multiple separate complications, but each new complication costs a PP. On a botch (all dice are 1s), the GM can create a complication for free, stepped up once per hitch past the first.

**Using a d4 in your roll:** If you voluntarily include a d4 complication (or stress) in your dice pool, you earn a PP (same as Hinder SFX from distinctions). This does not apply when forced to use d4-rated traits.

**Giving in:** Giving in during a contest (after having rolled at least once) earns a PP.

**Roleplaying:** The GM may award PPs for remarkable moments at the table (table-level agreement, not a hard rule).

**SFX:** Some SFX (including the default Hinder SFX) earn PPs.

### Spending Plot Points as a Player (p.28-29)

**Activate SFX:** Some SFX require a PP to activate. Effect lasts only for that roll.

**Add more dice (before rolling):** Spend a PP to include an additional die from a trait set already represented in the pool (e.g., a second skill, a second attribute). Requires narrative justification.

**Include more results (after rolling):** Spend a PP to add additional dice results to your total (beyond the initial two). Your total can be three, four, five dice, etc. Limited only by dice rolled and PPs available. These additional dice cannot also serve as effect dice.

**Activate an Opportunity:** When the GM rolls a 1, spend a PP to either step down an existing complication by one or step up an existing asset by one (max d12). Multiple opportunities = multiple steps. Only costs one PP per complication/asset affected.

**Create a temporary asset:** Spend 1 PP to create a d6 asset lasting the rest of the scene. Spend 2 PP total to keep it for the rest of the session. Spend an additional PP to make it "open" for any character to use. By default, the asset belongs only to the creating character.

**Create a relationship:** (when using relationship traits) Spend a PP to create a d6 relationship with a character you have no relationship with. Goes away at end of session unless preserved via growth/XP.

**Keep an extra effect die:** Spend a PP to keep a second effect die from the remaining rolled dice. If no dice remain, use d4.

**Roll a hero die:** (with Hero Dice mod) Spend a PP to roll a banked hero die and add its result to your total. Can be done after opponent has rolled, but before the GM announces the outcome.

**Share an asset:** Spend a PP to make a personal asset open for other characters in the scene.

**Interfere in a contest:** Spend a PP to enter an ongoing contest.

**Stay in the fight:** When about to be taken out, spend a PP to take a complication instead (size equal to the opposing effect die). With the Life Points mod, spend a PP to stay active when life points exceed threshold.

### Spending Plot Points as GM (p.29)

**Include more results:** From the bank, spend a PP to add additional dice results to a GMC's total (same rules as player spending).

**Activate SFX:** From the bank, spend a PP to activate GMC SFX. Effect lasts one roll.

**Avoid being taken out:** From the bank, spend a PP to prevent a GMC from being taken out; the GMC takes a complication equal to the opposing effect die instead.

---

## Plot Point Mods (pp.29)

### Starting Plot Points Variants (p.29)

Options include: more than 1 PP at start; roll d4 for starting PPs; roll a prime set and compare totals (highest gets 3 PP, lowest gets 1 PP, everyone else gets 2 PP).

### No Bank (p.29)

The GM has no private bank. When the GM spends PPs on a GMC roll, the PP goes directly to the targeted player. Players cannot use PPs just earned from a GMC spend until the current roll resolves. A major GMC cannot earn a PP when using a distinction as d4; instead the GM banks a d6 for that character to use in a future action. No limit on how many such dice are saved, but the GM still only uses two dice for a total.

---

## Hero Dice (pp.30-31)

### Earning Hero Dice (p.30)

On a heroic success, the player may bank a die equal to the **highest rolling die in the opposing dice pool**. These are hero dice. Players may save as many as they want (unless the GM rules only one hero die per die size). This does not negate the standard heroic success effect (stepping up the effect die); both apply.

If the GM rules only one per size, the player may step down the earned hero die to the next lowest available size if they already have one of that size.

### Using Hero Dice (pp.30-31)

Spend a PP to roll a banked hero die and add its result to your total. Can be done at any time after rolling, even after the opposition has rolled, but must be done before the GM announces the outcome. The hero die is consumed (erased from character file).

If the hero die rolls a 1, the GM may introduce a complication. However, the player may choose to take back the hero die (not adding it to the total) instead of accepting the PP from the complication. The PP spent to activate the hero die is still lost either way.

Hero dice do not persist across rolls in a contest. If your opponent beats your total (including the hero die), you cannot reuse that same hero die on your next roll.

### The GM and Hero Dice (p.31)

The GM does not use hero dice. When the GM rolls 5 or more above a player's total, the GM removes one hero die from that PC. The removed hero die must be equal to or less than the GM's highest rolling die. If the PC has no qualifying hero dice, nothing happens.

### Hero Dice as Plot Points (p.31)

With this mod, hero dice can be included in the dice pool before rolling (no PP cost, just erase from sheet). A hero die may also be spent in place of a PP in any situation where a PP is applicable (also erased). The die size does not matter unless an SFX specifies otherwise.

### Hero Dice as Effect Dice (p.31)

With this mod, a player may spend a PP to substitute a banked hero die for a low effect die from the roll. A heroic success does NOT step up a hero die used as an effect die (only applies to effect dice sourced from the actual roll).

---

## Doom Pool (pp.32-33)

### Setup and Core Mechanics (p.32)

The doom pool replaces the GM's bank of PPs and replaces difficulty dice. When using a doom pool, players earn and spend PPs from/to a central pile. The doom pool starts each session at minimum d6 d6. For global/cosmic scale sessions, 3-4 dice. For major campaign breakpoints, starting dice may be d8 or d10.

### Setting Difficulty (p.32)

The GM picks up some or all dice in the doom pool and rolls them, choosing two results to add for the total (standard procedure). The GM may then spend an additional die (not used in the total) by adding its result to the total; this spent die is **removed** from the doom pool. The remaining dice (including the two used for the total) stay in the pool.

### Adding to GMC Pools (p.32)

The GM may spend a die from the doom pool to add it to a GMC's dice pool during a contest (before rolling). The die is removed from the doom pool permanently.

### Doom Dice as PP Equivalent (p.32)

Doom dice can be spent like PPs: a d6 from the doom pool equals one PP (for activating GMC SFX, avoiding takeout, etc.). If only larger dice remain, the next highest die must be spent instead.

### Growing the Doom Pool (p.32)

When players roll hitches, instead of creating a complication, the GM adds a die to the doom pool of the **same size as the die that rolled the hitch**, and hands the player a PP. Alternatively, the GM can use a smaller die to step up an equal or larger existing die in the doom pool by one step.

### Doom Pool Scene Effects (pp.32-33)

**Create a complication, asset, or scene distinction:** Spend a doom die; the created element equals the size of the spent die. For a scene distinction, spend at least a d8.

**Interrupt the action order:** Spend a doom die equal to or greater than the largest combat/senses-related trait of the PC whose turn is next. A GMC goes instead; the GM picks who follows.

**Add a new extra:** Spend a doom die to create an extra with a single trait rated at that die's size.

**Introduce a minor or major GMC:** Spend a doom die equal to that GMC's highest rated trait. The GMC enters the scene ready to act.

**Split the group:** Spend a d10 or d12 to divide the party (minimum one PC per group).

**End the scene immediately:** Spend d12 d12 to cut the scene, with the GM deciding how it ends (including auto-win by villains).

### Limited Doom Pool (p.33)

Difficulty is determined normally (situation + GMC traits). Doom dice are spent from the pool to add dice to the difficulty or to include more dice in the total after rolling. Doom dice still replace PPs for the GM.

### Crisis Pools (p.33)

Each localized problem gets its own smaller pool of dice that functions like a doom pool but only for things that problem can influence. PCs can eliminate crisis dice by making a test opposed by the crisis pool. If they beat the pool's difficulty, they can remove a crisis die by applying an effect die at least one step larger. If the effect die is the same size or smaller, they step down a crisis die instead. Crisis pools reduced to zero dice are resolved.

Hitches rolled against a crisis pool can be activated (GM hands over a PP) to add a die of the same size to the crisis pool.

The doom pool can create crisis pools by spending dice directly into them.

---

## Assets (pp.34-35)

### Creating Assets (p.34)

**PP-created assets:** Spend 1 PP to create a named d6 asset. Some SFX allow d8 assets (called **stunts**). The asset lasts until end of scene, or until narratively irrelevant, or until eliminated.

**Extending duration:** Spend an additional PP to make the asset last the rest of the session.

**Sharing:** By default, an asset belongs only to its creator. Spend an additional PP to make it "open" for any character in the scene (including GMCs). You can also declare ownership to another character when creating it.

**Multiple assets in a pool:** You can add as many fictionally appropriate assets to a dice pool as you like without additional PP cost (the PP was already spent on creation).

**Stepping up assets:** Assets can be stepped up via GM opportunities (player spends a PP to activate a 1 rolled by the GM) or via SFX. Max d12, for the rest of the scene (even signature assets can be temporarily stepped up).

### Test-Created Assets (p.35)

Players can create assets larger than d6 without spending PPs by making a test. The player declares the action, assembles a dice pool, and the GM sets difficulty (typically d6 d6). The **effect die** of the test becomes the die rating of the asset. The GM may set a **cap** on asset size by setting the difficulty dice to that die rating (e.g., d10 d10 caps the asset at d10). After succeeding, the player may spend a PP to bank the asset for later, give it to another character, or extend its duration.

Failure on the test means no asset is gained. Hitches may generate complications as usual.

### Clues as Assets (p.35)

When a PC uses senses/perception, they are creating an asset. Default difficulty is d6 d6 unless the GM decides otherwise.

### Freeform Assets (p.34)

The GM may allow a successful test to create a free d6 asset (no PP cost). A player can then spend a PP to extend it to session duration.

---

## Complications (pp.36-38)

### Using Complications (p.36)

Complications go into the **opposition's dice pool** when they are relevant to the situation. Adding a complication to the opposition pool costs nothing. There is no limit to how many complications can be added or how many can affect a character. Only one complication should apply per specific hindrance (no "double jeopardy"; instead step up the existing one).

### Creating Complications (pp.36-37)

**From hitches:** When a player rolls a 1, the GM may hand over a PP and create a d6 complication. Additional hitches in the same roll step up the complication by one per hitch (no additional PP). The GM may alternatively step up an existing complication instead of creating a new one.

**As consequence of contests:** The die rating of a complication from a contest equals the winner's effect die. If from something other than a die roll, it starts at d6.

**From botch:** On a botch (all dice are 1), the GM creates a complication for free (no PP cost), starting at d6 and stepped up once per additional hitch.

**Stepping up existing complications:** The GM can rule that when a new complication's die rating would be equal to or smaller than an existing complication, the existing one steps up by one instead. A complication stepped up beyond d12 takes the character out.

**Overcoming beyond-d12 complications:** A character taken out by a beyond-d12 complication can spend a PP to act for a single test or contest, but may only keep **one** die for their total instead of two.

### d4 Complications (p.38)

When a complication is stepped down to d4, the next time it applies, the character adds it to their **own** dice pool (not the opposition's) and earns a PP. Immediately after that use, the d4 complication is eliminated, unless the player rolls a hitch, in which case the GM may step it back up to d6 or higher.

### Opportunities (p.37)

When the GM rolls a 1, any player may spend a PP to step down an existing complication by one (d6 -> d4, d4 -> eliminated). Multiple 1s allow multiple steps down. Cost is one PP per complication affected. Players can alternatively spend a PP on a GM's opportunity to step up an existing asset (max d12) for the rest of the scene.

### Recovering from Complications (pp.37-38)

Recovery is a test vs. a dice pool of the complication die + base difficulty of d8 d8. Other traits (location, circumstances) may modify the difficulty.

Outcomes:

- **Beat difficulty, effect die greater than complication:** Complication is eliminated.
- **Beat difficulty, effect die equal to or smaller than complication:** Complication is stepped down by one. Cannot try again until time passes.
- **Beat difficulty but roll a hitch:** GM may hand over a PP and introduce a new related complication (e.g., Broken Arm d10 -> Splinted Arm d6).
- **Fail to beat difficulty:** Complication remains unchanged.
- **Fail and roll hitches:** Complication is stepped up by one for each hitch rolled.

---

## Asset and Complication Mods (pp.39-43)

### Stress (pp.39-40)

Stress replaces complications for personal harm/injury. Complications remain for external hindrances. Stress does not require spending a PP to absorb a takeout; it is applied automatically.

**Inflicting stress:** If the PC has no stress or lower stress than the incoming die, the new stress die replaces the old. If the PC already has stress equal to or greater than the incoming die, existing stress steps up by one.

**d4 stress:** Functions like d4 complications. Goes into the player's pool, earns a PP. After the roll, it either goes away or (on a hitch) gets stepped up.

**Only one stress type at a time** is applied to the opposition pool unless the GM pays a PP to add an additional stress die. Characters can have both stress and complications simultaneously.

**Stressed out:** Stress stepped up past d12 takes the character out of the scene. By default, spending a PP cannot prevent this. While stressed out, the character is treated as having d12 stress for purposes of additional stress application.

### Types of Stress (p.40)

Common configurations: a single track, or Physical/Mental/Social, or Afraid/Angry/Exhausted/Injured/Insecure.

### Recovering Stress (p.40)

All stress steps down by one during any scene framed as rest/downtime/transition. No recovery occurs between consecutive action scenes. Remaining stress is recovered using the same procedure as recovering complications (p.37).

### Pushing Stress (p.40)

Spend a PP to add your stress die to your **own** dice pool instead of the opposition's pool for one test or contest. After the roll resolves, the stress die is stepped up by one (potentially causing stressed out if stepped past d12).

Some SFX build this into a distinction or power set, in which case it usually does not cost a PP (the drawback is the stress step-up).

### Trauma (p.41)

When stress is stepped up past d12 (stressed out), the character gains d6 **trauma** of the same stress type. Trauma functions like stress but is much harder to recover. While stressed out and having trauma, additional stress goes directly to trauma. Trauma stepped up beyond d12 means the character is permanently out (dead, lost, etc.).

**Recovering trauma:** Requires a test vs. base difficulty d8 d8 plus the trauma die. Stress automatically steps down by one in recovery scenes, but trauma does not.

- **Beat difficulty:** Trauma steps down by one.
- **Beat difficulty but roll a hitch:** GM may hand over a PP and introduce a complication for the next scene or inflict d6 stress of a different type (or step up existing different-type stress by one).
- **Fail to beat difficulty:** Trauma unchanged. Cannot retry until time passes.
- **Fail with hitches:** Trauma steps up by one per hitch. If stepped past d12, the character is permanently out.

### Shaken and Stricken (p.42)

Stress is applied directly to specific traits (e.g., attributes). The opponent chooses which trait receives stress. Stress on a trait is added to the opposition pool whenever that trait is used (except d4 stress, which goes into the player's pool per the standard d4 rule).

If stress applied to a trait exceeds that trait's die rating, the character is **shaken** (can only keep one die for total). If already shaken and stress on another trait would make them shaken again, they are **stricken** (taken out of scene). Stress stepped up beyond d12 on any trait also causes stricken.

### Life Points (pp.43)

Life points equal the sum of two trait die ratings (e.g., Physical + highest of Fight/Focus/Survive). Instead of complications or stress for harm, damage is calculated as the difference between what the player needed to roll and what they actually rolled.

**Ablative method:** Damage is subtracted from life points. At 0 or below, the character is taken out and clinging to life. A PP keeps them alive; each additional hit requires another PP. If negative damage equals original life point score, the character is dead.

**Threshold method:** Damage is split evenly into wounds and stun. Additional damage from weapons/powers goes to one or both. If wounds + stun exceed the life point score, the character is unconscious. If wounds alone exceed the life point score, the character is dead.

**Recovering life points:** Recovery test vs. d6 d6 plus relevant complications. The amount by which the player beats the difficulty is the number of life points recovered (ablative) or divided equally into recovered wounds and stun (threshold). All stun recovers at end of any rest scene; wounds require medical treatment/tests.
