# Chapter 2: Prime Characters -- Mechanical Rules Extraction

This document extracts all mechanically relevant rules from Chapter 2 of the Cortex Prime core book, focused on what a Discord bot implementation needs to know about character structure, trait sets, SFX, limits, character creation, and growth systems.

---

## Prime Sets (p.47)

A prime set is one of at least two trait sets (in addition to distinctions) that form the core of any Cortex Prime character. Prime sets provide the baseline dice for any dice pool on a test or contest. Each trait in a prime set has a die rating; if no die rating is noted, it defaults to d4. Distinctions are always a prime set, even when they carry no SFX beyond Hinder.

Recommended genre pairings (p.47):

- Grim Fantasy: Attributes + Skills
- Heist Action: Attributes + Roles
- Paranormal Mystery: Roles + Powers
- Prime Time Drama: Values + Relationships
- Romantic Fantasy: Relationships + Skills
- Superheroes: Affiliations + Powers

Prime sets can be expanded with SFX or trait statements, but the guidance is: no more than two trait sets with SFX and no more than two with trait statements in a single game.

---

## Trait Sets

### Affiliations (p.48)

Affiliations reflect how well a PC performs in specific contextual situations (environments, social structures, circumstances). They replace attributes when the game cares more about context than internal capability.

**Standard set:** Solo, Buddy, Team.

**Rating scheme:** Default is d8. If one is d10, another must be d6. Only three ratings exist for standard affiliations:

- d6: Disadvantaged.
- d8: Stable.
- d10: Advantaged.

**Character building (p.71):** Start with d8 in all three; any additional affiliation beyond three starts at d6.

### Attributes (p.49)

Attributes represent raw ability, prowess, and effort. They are the default baseline prime set.

**Standard set (classic):** Agility, Alertness, Intelligence, Strength, Vitality, Willpower.

**Alternative (triad):** Physical, Mental, Social.

**Rating scheme:** Usually d6 to d10, default d8. Higher ratings must be balanced by lower ones.

- d4: Poor.
- d6: Typical.
- d8: Excellent.
- d10: Remarkable.
- d12: Incredible (peak).

**Character building (p.70):** All characters start with d8 in each of three attributes (Physical, Mental, Social). You may step one down from d8 to d6 to step another up from d8 to d10. No starting attribute below d6 or above d10. If more than three attributes, each additional beyond the first three starts at d6 (p.71).

### Distinctions (p.50)

PCs have three distinctions that describe background, personality, and story role. Distinctions are always rated d8. Every distinction comes with the Hinder SFX for free.

**Hinder SFX (universal):** "Gain a PP when you switch out this distinction's d8 for a d4."

Additional SFX can be attached to distinctions but left locked until earned through growth/XP. A distinction may have more than the Hinder SFX; typically two additional SFX are chosen at character creation (one free Hinder per distinction, plus two more unlocked across all three distinctions).

**Rating mod:** Optionally, distinctions can be rated d4 to d12 instead of fixed d8. If so, the average should still be d8. When variable-rated, SFX unlocking can be tied to die rating: unlock one SFX at d4, another at d8, the last at d12.

**Highlight traits (p.50):** A mod where each distinction includes two highlight traits (usually skills) that get stepped up by one during character creation. Highlight skills start at d6 instead of d4. If a highlight skill appears on two distinctions it starts at d8; on all three, d10.

### Powers (p.51-52)

A power is a trait representing superhuman ability or extraordinary quality. Powers are not usually a prime set; they are added to a dice pool when their use is justified.

**Power list (p.51):** Attack, Durability, Elemental Control, Intangibility, Intelligence, Invisibility, Mimic, Movement, Psychic, Reflexes, Resistance, Senses, Shapeshift, Size-Changing, Sorcery, Stamina, Strength, Stretch, Teleport, Transmutation.

**Rating scheme (p.52):** d6 to d12. No default rating; if you don't have a power, you can't use it.

- d6: Minor/Influence.
- d8: Enhanced/Control.
- d10: Superhuman/Mastery.
- d12: Godlike/Supremacy.

Powers at d8 or d10 can justify automatic success when the outcome isn't in question (GM call).

**Power Sets (p.52):** A power set groups powers thematically with at least one SFX and at least one limit, under a single origin/source name. Each power set counts as its own trait set. A character with two power sets may include one power from each in a dice pool at no extra cost.

Power set SFX typically: double a power die, step up a die, or add a d6. Power set limits always involve earning a PP in return for shutting down the set or specific powers. A shut-down power set cannot contribute to dice pools until a recovery condition is met.

No set cap on powers per set (usually at least two). Most sets don't have more than one trait at d10 or d12. Characters may have more than one power set.

**Character building with powers (p.72):** If supers are common, each character gets two power sets in stage 3, each with two SFX and one limit. If rare, one power set, or the choice of a power set vs. 5 extra skill/talent points. Starting powers: number of d8 powers = number of power sets + 1. Powers can be stepped up using stage 5 points. No starting power above d10 unless godlike heroes. No power below d6 (stepping below d6 removes the power).

### Abilities (p.54)

A mod of power sets. An ability is a single rated trait with its own SFX attached, rather than a grouped power set. Abilities do NOT come with the Hinder SFX. When creating a character with an ability, choose one SFX for free; unlock others like distinction SFX.

Abilities have effect tags (Attack, Sensory, Movement, Control, Defense, Enhancement) and descriptor tags (Lightning Bolt, Flame Strike, etc.). Descriptor tags may replace the generic ability name on a character file.

Example ability format:
- Super Strength d10, Effect: Enhancement
- Each SFX costs a PP to activate (e.g., "Spend a PP to perform a fantastic feat of strength," "Spend a PP to throw a character out of a scene," etc.)

### Relationships (p.55)

Relationships represent intensity/importance of a connection to another character or group. A relationship contributes its die to a pool when the test/contest involves or is inspired by the linked character.

**Rating scheme:**

- d4: No feelings.
- d6: Matters, but not especially.
- d8: Invested.
- d10: Matters more than most.
- d12: Nobody matters more.

**Assignment at creation (p.55):** One at d10, one at d8, rest at d6 (simple assignment). With pathways, all start at d6 and step up through choices.

**During play (p.55):** A d6 relationship can be created by spending a PP (like a temporary asset). It lasts the session; at growth resolution it can be dropped or made permanent at d6. If no relationship exists, a PC can spend a PP to create one or assume a d4 default.

**Character building (p.72):** Most PCs get a relationship with each other PC at d6 for free. Step up using stage 5 points. Alternately: one at d10, one at d8, rest at d6.

### Reputations (p.55)

A relationship mod. Reputations represent standing with a group, organization, company, or culture. They work like relationships but can be affected by in-play actions. PCs may start with a die-rating cap due to lack of fame. Increasing reputation is a good milestone-based XP use.

### Resources (p.56)

Four types: Extras, Locations, Organizations, Props. Resources are represented by two or more dice of the same size (e.g., d6d6d6).

**Mechanic:** A resource die is committed before the pool is rolled, but rolled separately. If multiple resource dice are spent, only the highest is applied and added to the total. Spent dice are expended until recovered.

**Recovery:** Resources recover at session start or during downtime. Optionally, spend 1 PP to recover 1 resource die.

**Rating (p.56):** Nearly always multiples of d6. Each resource has a name, die rating, and optionally two tags (e.g., Politics, Crime) that inform when the resource applies.

**GM use:** GM can invoke GMC resources by spending a PP to add to an opposition pool total.

**Character building (p.72):** Resources cost one specialty/signature asset point in stage 5, giving d6d6 with two tags. Additional points can step up dice (d6d6 to d8d8) or add dice (d6d6 to d6d6d6). Max recommended: d8d8 or d6d6d6.

### Skills (p.57-58)

Skills represent natural talent, training, or experience. All framed as verbs.

**Default skill list:** Craft, Drive, Fight, Fix, Fly, Focus, Influence, Know (includes a free specialty), Labor, Move, Notice, Operate, Perform, Shoot, Sneak, Survive, Throw, Treat, Trick.

**Rating scheme:**

- d4: Untrained (default for all PCs).
- d6: Competent.
- d8: Expert.
- d10: Master.
- d12: Grandmaster.

**Character building (p.70):** Start with 9 points to step up skills (after highlight skills from distinctions). Each point steps one skill up one die size. GM may set cap (d10 common for starting characters).

### Specialties (p.59)

A specialty is a narrow focus within a skill. Standard specialties confer a bonus d6 to any test/contest in that narrow area involving the parent skill. No fixed list. A specialty applies when the subject matter overlaps, regardless of which skill is being rolled (e.g., Guns specialty applies to Shoot with a rifle, Fix with a cannon, Know about bullet caliber).

**Multi-level specialties mod (p.59):** Specialties start at d6 but can increase:

- Trained: d6
- Expert: d8 or d6d6
- Master: d10 or d8d8 or d6d6d6
- Grandmaster: d12 or d10d10 or d8d8d8 or d6d6d6d6

**No Skills, Just Specialties mod (p.59):** Specialties replace skills entirely, rated d8 to d12. If you don't have a specialty, you have no rating (no default).

**Skill and Specialty Split mod (p.59):** General skills cap at d6. Higher ratings (d8, d10, d12) only available for specialties. The specialty die replaces (not adds to) the skill die.

### Skill Pyramid mod (p.59)

To have a d10 skill, you need at least two d8 skills and three d6 skills. For d12: at least two d10, three d8, four d6. May require stepping up lower skills before higher ones to maintain the pyramid.

### Roles (p.58)

Roles are a skill-like mod that replaces skills. A role acts as a skill group. Games should have 3-6 roles.

**Rating assignment by number of roles:**

- Three roles: d10, d8, d4.
- Four roles: d10, d8, d6, d4.
- Five roles: d10, d8, d6, d6, d4.
- Six roles: d10, d8, d6, d6, d6, d4.

When using roles, specialties allow narrow focus within a role's area.

### Values (p.60)

Values represent how much specific principles/mores matter to a PC. A high rating means the value is intensely relevant to the character, not necessarily that they embody it positively.

**Rating scheme (p.60):** Same range as attributes (d4 to d12). Typical starting spread: one d10, one or two d8, one d4, rest d6. When a value steps up, another must step down by the same amount (fixed total). Values cannot go below d4 or above d12.

- d4: "Really not into this."
- d6: "Sure, this matters."
- d8: "Definitely on my radar."
- d10: "All over this."
- d12: "Heart and soul."

**Character building (p.72):** Assign d8 for first three values, d6 for rest. Step up by stepping others down. Typical result: one d10, one d4, two d8, rest d6.

### Signature Assets (p.64-65)

Iconic weapons, gear, or companions that contribute to dice pools. They work like regular temporary assets (extra die when justified) but are permanent and don't need to be created in play.

**Starting rating:** d6, can be stepped up.

Signature assets can have SFX (no default SFX). Typical SFX: spend a PP to step up a skill when used with the asset. Limit of three SFX per signature asset recommended.

**Recovery:** If knocked out or damaged, a player can recover a signature asset between sessions or by spending a PP at the beginning of the next scene (with narrative justification).

**Sharing:** Cannot be shared. If someone borrows another PC's signature asset, they must spend a PP to create a d6 asset as normal.

**Character building (p.70):** Players have 5 points for specialties and signature assets. Each point can: add a specialty to a skill at d6+, create a signature asset at d6, or step up a d6 signature asset to d8.

### Trait Statements (p.65)

A sentence or phrase clarifying/refining a trait. Especially useful for values, relationships, or attributes.

**Challenging Statements (p.65):** When you act contrary to the statement, you triple the trait die for that roll. After challenging, the trait steps down by one. At session end or growth resolution: either rewrite the statement (trait returns to original rating) or keep the statement and the reduced die (if the set has fixed total steps, increase another trait to compensate).

**Statements as Distinction Alternates mod (p.66):** Trait statements can replace distinctions entirely. Must still maintain at least three prime sets.

### Talents (p.66)

A special trait with no die rating, consisting of descriptive text and an SFX. Talents are separate from distinctions and often associated with another trait group (skills, roles).

**Format:**
- Talent Name
- Descriptive text (optional)
- Activation: cost or triggering event
- Effect: benefit

Most characters start with 2 talents and can add more through growth.

**Example talents with exact mechanics:**

**Unrelenting Force (p.66):** Activation: GM gets a heroic success against you. Effect: Ignore the GM's heroic success if the roll beats yours by 5-9 (e.g., effect die step-up or automatic takeout is negated). A margin of 10+ remains a normal heroic success.

**Your Shoelace Is Untied (p.66):** Activation: Contest with major GMC or PC; spend a PP. Effect: For each die the GM keeps in total after the first (including PP-bought dice), you get a d8 asset usable on your next contest roll. GM may choose not to keep a second die.

**Hopeless Romantic (p.66):** Activation: Introduce/identify a past fling (max one per scene). Effect: Gain a d8 asset linked to that character, but GM gains a d8 complication to use against you or an ally.

---

## SFX -- Special Effects (p.61-63)

SFX are exception-based rules for trait sets. They break normal rules, modify test/contest outcomes, and add texture. All distinctions get the Hinder SFX for free. Other trait sets (power sets, skills, signature assets) may have their own SFX.

### SFX Construction (p.62)

An SFX is a combination of a cost and a benefit. The standard Hinder SFX: cost = "use distinction as d4," benefit = "earn a PP."

**Costs:**
- Spend a PP (very common)
- Step down a beneficial die (attribute, skill, or asset)
- Step up a non-beneficial die (complication)
- Choose to do/introduce something risky ("When you walk into a volatile situation...")
- Create a d8 complication
- Shut down a trait set (can't use until restored)

**Benefits:**
- Earn a PP
- Add a d6 to the dice pool
- Step up a beneficial die (specialty or asset)
- Double a beneficial die (specialty or asset)
- Step down a non-beneficial die (complication)
- Introduce a non-mechanical story detail
- Rename a complication
- Reroll a single die
- Create a d8 asset for the rest of the scene

SFX often combine both a cost and a triggering condition, especially for broader/more potent benefits.

### Dice Tricks in SFX (p.62)

- **Stepping up:** Increase die size by one (d6 to d8, d10 to d12).
- **Stepping down:** Decrease die size by one (d8 to d6, d12 to d10).
- **Rerolling:** Roll a die again, ignore previous result, use new result.
- **Doubling:** Add another die of the same size to the pool before rolling.

Most SFX tricks affect unrolled dice. SFX calling for step up/down of an effect die apply after the effect die is chosen.

### Six Standard SFX (p.63)

These are ready-made templates for distinction SFX:

**The Exchange:** Step up or double one useful die for the scene, but step down one other die until a recovery action.

**The Price:** Step up or double one useful die for the scene OR take a d8 asset for the scene (choose one, not both), but also take a d8 complication.

**The Swap:** Spend a PP to use a different die than normally appropriate, based on distinction.

**The Edit:** Spend a PP to declare a beneficial thing to be true in the fiction, based on distinction.

**The Folly:** Earn a PP when you choose to do something detrimental related to the distinction.

**The Shutdown:** Earn a PP when you declare that, due to appropriate circumstances based on distinction, you have lost access to one or more attributes/skills/roles/etc. for the scene and cannot use them.

---

## Limits (p.63)

A limit is an SFX mod that introduces vulnerabilities providing PP. Most limits use shutdown cost + earn PP benefit. A shutdown always has a specific recovery condition (e.g., "restore at beginning of next scene").

**GM activation:** The GM can activate limits by spending a PP (or doom pool die). The GM should first offer the player the chance to activate it themselves (earning the PP). If the player declines, the GM activates it; the PP the GM spends goes to the pile, not the player.

---

## Character Creation Methods

### Archetypes (p.68-69)

A partially created character used for quick generation. Archetypes include: pre-assigned distinctions (with Hinder SFX unlocked), pre-assigned attributes or other traits, choice of two signature assets, and highlight skills.

**Steps:**
1. Select an archetype.
2. Choose two distinction SFX to unlock (from among those on the three provided distinctions).
3. Select one of the two listed signature assets.

Highlight skills from archetype distinctions start at d6 instead of d4. If a highlight skill appears on two distinctions, it starts at d8; all three, d10. After adjusting highlights, each player has 9 additional points to step up skills (each point = one step). GM may cap starting skills at d10. Players assign three specialties to skills rated d6+ and an additional specialty if Know is at least d6.

### Scratch-Built (p.70-71)

**Stage 1 -- Adjust Attributes:** All start at d8 in Physical, Mental, Social. May step one down to d6 to step another up to d10. No attribute below d6 or above d10 at creation.

**Stage 2 -- Choose Distinctions:** Choose three distinctions, noting highlight skills.

**Stage 3 -- Choose Distinction SFX:** Three Hinder SFX are pre-selected (free). Choose two additional SFX. When designing custom distinctions, GM may develop new SFX or use the six standard SFX.

**Stage 4 -- Step Up Skills:** Step up highlight skills first (one step per appearance across distinctions, up to d10). Then distribute 9 skill points. Each point = one die step.

**Stage 5 -- Choose Specialties and Signature Assets:** 5 points total. Each point can: add a specialty to a skill at d6+, create a signature asset at d6, or step up a d6 signature asset to d8.

Options with 5 points include: 5 specialties and 0 assets, 4 specialties and 1 d6 asset, 3 specialties and 1 d8 asset, 2 specialties and 3 d6 assets, 1 specialty and 1 d8 asset + 2 d6 assets.

**Stage 6 -- Biographical Information:** Name, background, appearance, narrative details.

### Character Building with Other Traits (p.71-72)

Adjustments for non-standard trait sets:

**Affiliations:** Start with d8 in all three; additional affiliations at d6.

**Attributes:** Baseline three at d8. Additional attributes beyond three start at d6.

**Resources:** Cost 1 specialty/asset point in stage 5. Gives d6d6 with two tags. Extra points step up dice or add dice. Max recommended d8d8 or d6d6d6.

**Roles:** Skip stage 4 entirely. Assign fixed arrays based on role count (see Roles section above).

**Skill and Specialty Split:** In stage 4, no skill above d6 except as specialty. Stage 5 points can also step up specialties but cannot raise d4 skills to d6.

**Talents:** Choose from list or create during stage 3. Usually start with 2.

**Trait Statements:** Write during last stage once other PCs and direction are established.

**Values:** Assign during stage 1. d8 for first three, d6 for rest. Step up by stepping others down. Typical result: one d10, one d4, two d8, rest d6.

**Multi-Level Specialties:** In stage 5, can step up specialties from d6 instead of adding new ones. Starting characters rarely start with d12 specialties.

**Powers:** See power sets section above for detailed character building rules.

**Relationships:** PCs get d6 relationship with each other PC for free. Step up using stage 5 points. Alternative: one d10, one d8, rest d6.

**Reputations:** Like relationships. Cap die ratings during creation to match expected starting notoriety.

### Pathways (p.73-80)

Collaborative setting and character creation process. Creates a map showing connections between PCs, places, events, objects. Intended for long-term series.

**Stage types:**

**Standard stage:** Connect character to one element (existing or new). Gain a resource, signature asset, skill, or specialty: add new at d6 or step up existing by one.

**Major stage:** Add two new elements. Same gains as standard, plus define and add a distinction.

**Meta stage:** Add one element plus one of: draw connection between non-PC elements, destroy a connection and add a new element, or introduce an element for another PC. Gains: same as major stage, plus add a power set or ability if using those traits.

**Default pathways table (9 stages):**

| Stage | Type | Title | Options |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Major | Origin | Rich, Ordinary, Gifted, Strange, Alien |
| 2 | Standard | Youth | Jock, Average, Geek, Outsider, Paragon |
| 3 | Meta | Focus | Money, Life, Status, Technology, Paranormal |
| 4 | Standard | Road | Risky, Straight & Narrow, Lofty, Underground, Ethical |
| 5 | Major | Life-Changing Event | Advancement, Tragedy, Manifestation, First Contact, Destiny |
| 6 | Standard | Priority | Friends & Family, Work, Moving Forward, Looking Back, Performance |
| 7 | Meta | Modus Operandi | Loyalty, Shady Business, Against the Grain, Outside Normal Channels, Special Gifts |
| 8 | Standard | Motivation | Others, Self, The Cause, The Job, The World |
| 9 | Major | Identity | The Sidekick, The Foil, The Rebel, The Specialist, The Hero |

**Navigation constraint:** Each stage choice must be directly below the previous choice, or one column to the left or right.

**Recommended stages:** Start with first 5, optionally progress to remaining 4.

**Example trait allocation per stage (from Engineer example, p.78-79):**

- Origin (Major): First distinction + highlight skills + 2 skill steps + 1 specialty/asset. All attributes start at d6.
- Youth (Standard): 2 skill steps + 1 specialty/asset + step 1 attribute up by 1.
- Focus (Meta): Second distinction + highlight skills + 2 skill steps + 1 specialty/asset + unlock 1 SFX.
- Road (Standard): 2 skill steps + 1 specialty/asset + step 1 attribute up by 1.
- Life-Changing Event (Major): Third distinction + highlight skills + 1 skill step + 1 specialty/asset + unlock 1 SFX + final attribute step.

## Growing Characters (p.82-85)

All growth methods are mods. A game can run without any character growth system.

### Session Records (p.82)

At session end, players note the session name on their character file.

**Callbacks (p.82):** A PC references a past session event while performing a task. When making a callback, gain a benefit equivalent to what a PP could do: activate an SFX, keep an extra die result in total, or create an asset reflecting past experience. Each specific session can only be called back once per session.

**Training Up (p.82):** Spend sessions from record to make permanent improvements. A spent session remains on record but can no longer be used for callbacks or training.

- 1 session: Turn a session asset into a signature asset (or relationship).
- 1 session: Switch out a distinction (or trait statement) for a new one.
- 2 sessions: Step up a signature asset (or relationship).
- 2 sessions: Add a new specialty.
- 2 sessions: Unlock a new SFX.
- 3 sessions: Step up a skill (or resource, role, value, or power).
- 4 sessions: Step up one attribute (or affiliation) and step down another.

Max die ratings of d12 apply to skills, attributes, and assets. If switching out a distinction, the new one has as many SFX unlocked as the original (though they may be different SFX).

### Growth Pool (p.83)

PCs gain new traits and advance current traits through a growth pool (a pool of dice built over the course of a game). This method uses trait statements extensively.

**Earning growth pool dice:**
- Challenging a trait statement (adds dice to pool).
- Successfully recovering stress or complications with someone else's help.

**Tag Scenes (p.83):** Special scenes at session end. Two things happen: rewrite statements and step up traits.

**Rewriting Statements (p.83):** For each challenged statement: if the PC changed perspective, rewrite the statement and restore the trait to its original die rating. If not, keep statement and reduced rating. For traits with fixed totals (values), pick other traits to increase by the same amount. For relationships or non-fixed traits, if staying at lowered rating, add another die to growth pool equal to the new rating.

**Stepping Up Traits (p.83):** Select one trait to step up or add a new one (new traits begin at d4, max d12). Roll growth pool + highest stress/complication from the session (even if recovered). GM sets difficulty as two dice:
- First die = the target trait level being stepped up to.
- Second die based on trait type:
  - Attribute or Affiliation: d12
  - Distinction, Role, or Power: d10
  - Skill, SFX, or Value: d8
  - Relationship, Resource, or Signature Asset: d6

PP cannot affect this roll. Ignore all hitches. On success: step up trait, growth pool dice are spent. On failure or tie: you can still step up, but must step something else down to compensate; growth pool dice carry over to next session.

### Milestones (p.84-85)

Alternate progress tracking that earns XP. Characters have two milestones: one shared by the group, one personal. Personal milestones can be built into archetypes, suggested with distinctions, or custom.

**Three XP levels per milestone:**

- **1 XP:** Can be hit as many times as it applies (or once per test/contest).
- **3 XP:** Can only be hit once per scene.
- **10 XP:** Can only be hit once per session. For shared milestones, unusable until next session after being hit. For personal milestones, closes the milestone completely; player chooses a new one at session end.

**Session Milestones (p.85):** GM offers at session start or reveals after major turning points. Ties PCs into the story. Can replace personal milestone or (if GM allows) the group milestone until completed.

### XP Unlockables (p.85)

XP may be spent between scenes. Multiple upgrades can be unlocked at once.

**5 XP:**
- Train a new specialty at Expert d8.
- Unlock an SFX.
- Add a d6 signature asset.

**10 XP:**
- Add a d8 signature asset.
- Add a new locked SFX to a distinction or signature asset.
- Upgrade an existing trait from d6 to d8.
- Upgrade an existing Expert d8 specialty to Master d10.

**15 XP:**
- Upgrade an existing trait from d8 to d10.
- Upgrade an existing Master d10 specialty to Grandmaster d12.
- Add a d10 signature asset.

**20 XP:**
- Upgrade an existing trait from d10 to d12.
- Add a d12 signature asset.

## SFX Examples from Character Files

These are concrete SFX implementations found in the chapter's example character files and archetypes.

### From the Engineer archetype (p.68-69)

**Kitbash** (The World Is My Workshop): Spend a PP to gain a d8 asset for the rest of the scene.

**Out of Stock** (The World Is My Workshop): Gain a PP when you declare you don't have the tools you need to make a repair or build something others are asking you to do.

**Intriguing** (Boundless Curiosity): Spend a PP to step up or double your Mental die when making inquiries or investigating something new.

**Killed the Cat** (Boundless Curiosity): Gain a PP when you poke your nose into something secret and are discovered.

**Full Speed Ahead** (Can't Stay Long, Too Much To Do): Spend a PP to reroll your dice when time is of the essence.

**High Demand** (Can't Stay Long, Too Much To Do): Gain a PP when you leave an important scene to help someone rather than help the people you're with.

### From Hammerheads character file (p.47)

Each distinction has Hinder, plus one additional SFX:

- "Your Life Before" distinction SFX: Spend a PP to step up an attribute when you connect to your old life. Alternative: Add d6 to the crisis pool to double your attribute die when you connect to your old life.
- "Your Approach/Attitude" distinction SFX: Spend a PP to reroll your dice when you align with your true nature. Alternative: Add d6 to the crisis pool to step up your training package die when you align with your true nature.
- "Your Quirk/Quality" distinction SFX: Spend a PP to double your relationship die when your assistance embraces your quirk or quality. Alternative: Add d6 to the crisis pool to step up a relationship die you include in your pool when you embrace your quirk or quality.

### From Eidolon Alpha character file (p.47)

**Summon** (Endarch Distinction): Shut down this endarch distinction to summon your Eidolon on your next turn.

## Bot Implementation Notes

Key mechanical data a bot needs to model per character:

1. **Trait sets** (configurable per game): which prime sets are in use, each with name, die rating, and optional SFX/statements.
2. **Distinctions** (always 3 by default): name, d8 rating, Hinder SFX (always present), additional SFX (locked/unlocked state), optional highlight traits.
3. **Die ratings** as discrete values from the set {d4, d6, d8, d10, d12}.
4. **SFX** per trait: trigger condition, cost, benefit, locked/unlocked state.
5. **Limits** per power set: trigger, shutdown behavior, recovery condition.
6. **PP (Plot Points)** tracking per player.
7. **Signature assets**: name, die rating, optional SFX.
8. **Specialties**: name, parent skill (if applicable), die rating (d6 default, or multi-level).
9. **Resources**: name, dice pool (e.g., d6d6d6), tags, spent/available tracking.
