## 1. The Power List (pp. 186-197)

### 1.1 Power Descriptions

Powers are trait dice included in dice pools. Each power has a die rating (d6 through d12) that scales with scope/potency. Some powers start at d8 (Durability, Intelligence, Reflexes, Stamina, Strength) because d6 is considered "human level" for those.

#### Attack Powers (Blasts, Weapons) (p. 186)

Generic category. The die rating scales destructive output:

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Small arms fire, dangerous close combat weapons |
| d8 | Automatic rifles, grenades |
| d10 | Heavy explosives, lightning bolts |
| d12 | Truly devastating, even if narrow area of effect |

Attack power names define scope (Fire Blast, Cold Blast, Psychic Blast, etc.). Psychic Blasts target minds (useless against mindless). Range vs. melee is situational, not a flat advantage/disadvantage.

#### Durability (p. 187)

Resistance to injury and harmful effects.

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Enhanced Durability d8 | Toughened skin/muscle, withstand minor blunt trauma, low-level temperature extremes |
| Superhuman Durability d10 | Bulletproof skin, resistance to extreme temperatures/hazards |
| Godlike Durability d12 | Invulnerability to almost all conventional injury |

Mechanical notes: Also represents force fields and hardened objects. Used to resist energy attacks. May include life support/environmental protection. SFX can extend protection to specific types (disease, toxins). For magic or psychic protection, use Mystic Resistance or Psychic Resistance instead.

#### Elemental Control (Influence/Control/Mastery/Supremacy) (pp. 187-188)

Must specify element type: Air, Cosmic, Earth, Electric, Fire/Heat, Gravity, Ice/Cold, Kinetic/Telekinetic, Light, Magnetic, Negative, Sonic, Weather, Water.

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Elemental Influence d6 | Minor/basic control (extinguish candles, cool a room, short out household appliances) |
| Elemental Control d8 | Significant local control (extinguish burning room, snap-freeze room air, short building electrical) |
| Elemental Mastery d10 | Citywide control (extinguish burning skyscraper, freeze a city street, bring down city power grid) |
| Elemental Supremacy d12 | Regional control (extinguish forest fire, freeze Lake Michigan, reroute national power grid) |

Mechanical notes: At Mastery/Supremacy, elements can overlap (Ice Control can do some Weather Control things). Influence/Control rarely step outside standard element boundaries. Power sets with elemental control often also include Energy Blast, Flight, Senses, and SFX like Area Attack, Energy Absorption, Multipower.

#### Intangibility (p. 188)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Mild molecular dispersal; reduce some physical attacks; seep through porous obstacles (chicken wire, barred gates) |
| d8 | Substantial fluidity/dispersal; seep through tiny holes; reduce most physical attacks |
| d10 | Ghostlike/out of phase; walk through almost any physical obstacle except super-high-density; very little noise; physical attacks rarely affect you |
| d12 | Completely out of phase with reality including energy waveforms |

#### Intelligence (pp. 188-189)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Enhanced Intelligence d8 | Complex mental problems, calculation, recall, applied knowledge |
| Super Intelligence d10 | Living computer; numerous simultaneous rational operations; vast recall |
| Godlike Intelligence d12 | Beyond terrestrial computers; nigh-instant access to vast knowledge |

Mechanical notes: Almost always used to create assets or apply complications, and to enhance specialties. Does not replace having a high Know skill.

#### Invisibility (pp. 189-190)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Blurs/obscures visual image; works in mirrors, electronic surveillance, impaired vision; or psychic "ignore me" field |
| d8 | Chameleon blending, ghostlike transparency, psychic misdirection; still visible if they focus |
| d10 | Completely invisible to standard visual means; no shadow; certain spectrums (infrared, dimensional locators) may detect |
| d12 | Impossible to detect with any visual-based sense; never shows on any device; no energy signatures |

#### Mimic (p. 189)

To manifest a power: create an asset with a test or contest using Mimic's die. May require touch or causing stress, defined by SFX. The asset created serves as the power trait. Mimic's die rating limits the scope of the copied power (Mimic d8 copying Flight won't produce supersonic speed, even if the asset die is d12).

#### Movement Powers (Speed/Flight/Swing/Airwalk/Burrow/Leap/Swim) (pp. 189-190)

**Speed (ground):**

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Speed d6 | World's fastest humans |
| Enhanced Speed d8 | Speed of a horse |
| Superhuman Speed d10 | Faster than a bullet train |
| Godlike Speed d12 | Travel around the world in moments |

**Flight (air/space):**

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Flight d6 | Hawk or news chopper |
| Subsonic Flight d8 | Missile or passenger airliner |
| Supersonic Flight d10 | Jet fighter |
| Space Flight d12 | Swift interplanetary travel |

Other movement powers (Swing, Airwalk, Burrow, Swim, Leap) operate at same speed as Speed but differ in access/environment. Teleport is separate.

Mechanical rule (p. 190): Movement powers at d8+ include environmental survival. Enhanced Swim d8 = breathe underwater. Subsonic Flight d8 = no negative effects of high velocity. Space Flight d12 = survive vacuum.

#### Psychic Powers (Mind Control/Telepathy/Animal Control/Plant Control) (pp. 190-191)

Used to create complications on targets. If complication steps beyond d12 and target is stressed out, effect is total. Until then, target can resist/fight off, with the complication hindering them.

**Mind Control:**

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Push target to do something they're already inclined to do; mildly intensify senses |
| d8 | Override impulse control, remove inhibitions, provoke irrational behavior; short hallucinations |
| d10 | Take over motor control/movements; vivid hallucinations lasting hours; briefly override core beliefs |
| d12 | Complete possession; create entire fictional universes in mind; permanently alter beliefs/perceptions |

Complication created with Mind Control hampers target only if they resist. If they go along, complication doesn't pose problems.

**Telepathy:**

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Maintain mental link with effort; talk/share thoughts |
| d8 | Read surface thoughts, discern emotions, share one or two senses, link half-dozen minds |
| d10 | Probe for memories/thoughts/instincts; persistent links among large groups across distance; block/influence specific memories |
| d12 | Constant communication with vast numbers; skim surface thoughts of everyone on the planet; implant new life histories |

No roll needed on willing targets. Unwilling targets must be taken out (complication stepped beyond d12) before full information extraction.

**Animal Control / Plant Control:** Function like elemental control (p. 183), with die rating = scope of control. d6 = nudges/suggestions, d12 = supremacy over all animal/plant life.

#### Reflexes (p. 191)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Enhanced Reflexes d8 | 2-3x normal human response time and hand-eye coordination |
| Superhuman Reflexes d10 | ~10x normal response time and coordination |
| Godlike Reflexes d12 | React as if world has slowed to a crawl; lightning-fast hand-eye coordination |

#### Resistance (p. 191)

Types: Mystic Resistance, Psychic Resistance (most common). Specific resistances can also come from Durability or SFX.

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Slight resistance, still more than normal |
| d8 | Enhanced, turns aside most standard attacks of this type |
| d10 | Superhuman, substantial defense against most |
| d12 | Godlike, nigh-invulnerability to this attack type |

#### Senses (pp. 191-192)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Additional senses (Cybernetic Sense, Mystic Sense, etc.) for information access |
| Enhanced Senses d8 | Extraordinary awareness, closer to predatory animals |
| Superhuman Senses d10 | Beyond nature, incredible awareness |
| Godlike Senses d12 | Cosmic threads of information and perception |

Mechanical notes: d6 Senses are usually additional/alternate senses. Extraordinary senses (sonar, sixth sense) often represented by SFX that let you reroll dice. Pairs with Intelligence.

#### Shapeshift (p. 192)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Minor facial/appearance changes; can't closely mimic anyone |
| d8 | External form of someone else (fools most onlookers); may take external form of animal/creature |
| d10 | Full shift into another living physical form at cellular level; fools instruments; non-living shapes still register as organic |
| d12 | Shapeshift into anything, living and non-living; fools cosmic senses; you become that thing |

Mechanical notes: Can create assets (claws, wings) lasting the scene, extendable with PP. If you regularly create something, it should be a power trait in the power set. Characters who only shapeshift into one form probably don't have Shapeshift; instead they have the other form's powers with a limit that shuts them down when not in that form.

#### Size-Changing (Grow, Shrink) (p. 192)

| Rating | Grow | Shrink |
|--------|------|--------|
| d6 | Bulk up (snap out of restraints, fit cramped spaces) | Compress mass (slip restraints, fit cramped spaces) |
| d8 | ~15 feet, more than double size | Doll/small animal |
| d10 | Building-sized, ~100 feet | Insect-sized |
| d12 | Truly massive, possibly without limit | Microscopic, sub-molecular |

Mechanical rules: Cannot use both Grow and Shrink simultaneously. Power sets with these have a limit that shuts down associated power traits along with the size-changing power (e.g., shutting down Grow also shuts down the Superhuman Strength and Durability that came with it). Large size vulnerability handled by limit (e.g., "Huge: Earn a PP when your Grow becomes a complication for you").

#### Sorcery (p. 192)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Novice d6 | Parlor tricks, prestidigitation, conjuring without stage equipment |
| Adept d8 | Genuine summoning/controlling mystic forces; constructs, illusions, commune with dimensions, invoke physics changes |
| Master d10 | Great mystical powers; longer-lasting constructs/objects; bend physics; dispel others' magic |
| Supreme d12 | World-shattering mystic power; far-reaching changes; bring things to/from dimensions; empower mystical objects/creatures |

Mechanical notes: Sorcery cannot usually inflict stress on its own, but can create assets and complications. Included in power sets with specific magical effect traits (Mystic Blast, Flight, Strength, Teleport, etc.).

#### Stamina (pp. 192-193)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Enhanced Stamina d8 | Faster healing/recovery; resist minor diseases; maximum effort for an hour+ |
| Superhuman Stamina d10 | Rapid recovery from injury; resist most terrestrial diseases/toxins; max effort for several hours |
| Godlike Stamina d12 | Extremely rapid recovery from near-fatal wounds; resist extraterrestrial diseases; almost limitless max effort |

Mechanical notes: Most used for recovery. Also used against attacks targeting endurance/staying power, or inducing paralysis/sleep/fatigue. Extends lifespan. Characters with Stamina are resistant to drugs/alcohol/caffeine.

#### Strength (p. 193)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Enhanced Strength d8 | Flip cars, break solid barriers, bend ordinary iron bars |
| Superhuman Strength d10 | Lift/throw vehicles, smash through stone/metal, tear apart most barriers |
| Godlike Strength d12 | Hurl objects into orbit, push over tall buildings, demolish structures |

#### Stretch (p. 194)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Reach across a room; double usual reach |
| d8 | Reach across a street, up a building, down an elevator shaft |
| d10 | Several city blocks; clear buildings, rivers, ravines |
| d12 | Ridiculous distances (lakes, oceans, orbit) but less useful at extreme extension |

Can be used as movement, defense (elastic body mitigates damage), or offense (punch across a street).

#### Teleport (p. 194)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Blink within a room or gap between buildings; usually requires line of sight |
| d8 | Across several miles (metropolitan area); multiple jumps city-to-city |
| d10 | Around the world in single/multiple jumps; possibly to the moon |
| d12 | Vast distances; other planets or galaxies |

At d10/d12, can optionally only allow dimensional/world travel, with Earth travel being a stunt.

#### Transmutation (p. 194)

| Rating | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| d6 | Affect integrity/cohesion (soften, harden, degrade) but not change substance |
| d8 | Alter properties to solid/liquid/gas, or change within same category (inorganic or organic) |
| d10 | Chemical/elemental level; change any substance living or nonliving into another |
| d12 | Change any object into another regardless of original substance, shape, or qualities |

Mechanical notes: Effects are typically temporary. Most tests/contests create assets or complications representing the change. Can inflict stress (disintegrator ray) but effect not complete/permanent unless target is stressed out. Die rating informs how well it alters targets with Durability/Resistance.

### 1.2 Power SFX (pp. 195-197)

These are generic SFX templates for use with power sets. PP = Plot Point.

| SFX Name | Mechanical Effect |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Absorption** | If you succeed in a [type of attack] contest, instead of inflicting stress/complication, convert opponent's effect die into a stunt asset for yourself OR step up a power by one for your next roll. Spend a PP to create this stunt asset if opponent succeeds. |
| **Afflict** | Add a d6 and step up your effect die by one when inflicting [type] complication on a target. |
| **Area Attack** | Spend a PP to add a d6 and keep an additional effect die for each additional target past the first. Area effects are resisted individually by all targets against the attacker's single total. Especially useful against mobs. |
| **Boost** | Shut down your highest rated [power set] power to step up another [power set] power by one. Activate an opportunity to restore the power. |
| **Burst** | Step up or double a power die against a single target. Remove the highest rolling die from your pool and add 3 dice together for your total. |
| **Constructs** | Add a d6 and step up your effect die by one when using [power set] to create assets. |
| **Dangerous** | Add a d6 to your dice pool for an attack and step down the highest die in pool by one. Step up the effect die by one. |
| **Focus** | If a pool includes a [power set] power, you may replace two dice of equal size with one die one step larger. |
| **Healing** | Add [power] to your dice pool when helping others recover complications. Spend a PP to recover your own or another's [complication type] by one. |
| **Immunity** | Spend a PP to ignore complications from [specific attack type]. |
| **Invulnerable** | Spend a PP to ignore [type of complication] for a test or contest unless caused by [specific attack type]. |
| **Multipower** | Use two or more [power set] powers in a single dice pool and step each power down by one for each additional power beyond the first. Only step down the power dice, not all dice in the pool. |
| **Second Chance** | Spend a PP to reroll when using any [power set] power. |
| **Second Wind** | Before assembling a dice pool including a [power set] power, give the GM a complication attached to you (GM can re-assign it at any time). Step up the [power set] power by one for this roll. |
| **Unleashed** | Step up or double any [power set] power for one roll. If the roll fails, you gain a complication equal in size to your power die. |
| **Versatile** | Split power trait die into two dice stepped down by one; or three dice stepped down by two. (d10 becomes d8+d8 or d6+d6+d6; d12 becomes d10+d10 or d8+d8+d8.) Each resulting die counts as a power trait die for other SFX. |

---

### 1.3 Power Limits (pp. 197-198)

Players can activate limits voluntarily to earn PP. The GM may also spend PP to activate limits (but this doesn't earn the player a PP), so the player always gets first option. Each limit includes restoration conditions.

| Limit Name | Mechanical Effect | Restoration |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Conscious Activation** | If taken out, asleep, or unconscious, shut down [power set]. | Restore when you awake. Usually applies to a specific stress type (physical or emotional). |
| **Exhausted** | Shut down any [power set specific] power to gain a PP. | Activate an opportunity to restore the power. Shuts down specific power traits, not the whole set. |
| **Gear** | Shut down [power set] and gain a PP. | Test to restore (GM sets difficulty based on likelihood of recovery). Represents equipment that can be lost/stolen/broken. |
| **Growing Dread** | Both 1 and 2 on your dice count as hitches when using a [power set] power. | Persistent; no shutdown/restore cycle. Good for dangerous/mystical power sources. |
| **Mutually Exclusive** | Shut down [power set A] to activate [power set B]. | Shut down [power set B] to restore [power set A]. |
| **Uncontrollable** | Change any [power set] power into a complication and gain a PP. | Activate an opportunity or remove the complication to restore the power. The complication can be targeted/recovered like any other. |

## 2. The Ability List (pp. 198-212)

### 2.1 Ability System Mechanics (p. 198)

Abilities are a trait type distinct from powers. Do NOT mix powers and abilities in the same game. Each ability has:
- A die rating (d4 through d12)
- An effect category: Attack, Sensory, Movement, Control, Defense, or Enhancement
- Descriptors (player-created, customizable)
- Limits (almost always: "Earn a PP when this ability is shut down")
- SFX (one free at creation; unlock one at d8 and one at d12; during growth, can add a new descriptor instead of stepping up die)

**SFX that step down effect dice (p. 198):** Compare your effect die to the ability die being used against you. If your effect die >= attacker's ability die, step opponent's effect die down by one. If your effect die > attacker's ability die, ignore opponent's effect die completely.

## 3. Abilities as Gear (p. 217)

### 3.1 Core Mechanics

Any ability can be replicated as a device. Gear works like abilities except:
- **Universal limit:** Gear can be lost, broken, or stolen. Without gear, you have no die or SFX. In the wrong hands, your gear could be used against you.
- Gear doesn't need to map to a single ability. Borrow SFX from abilities matching the gear's effect.
- **Design a gear piece:** choose an effect category, a descriptor, and SFX.
- **Growth/advancement:** add more SFX (represents tinkering/lab work). Instead of stepping up die rating, can add a new descriptor (multi-purpose gear).

### 3.2 Mods for Armor and Weapons (p. 217)

Optional mods for games where weapons/armor are important. Adds complexity.

**Ablative Armor:** Abilities representing armor/protection prevent damage but step down afterward. Compare armor ability die to attacker's ability die (or skill/attack trait if no ability):
- If your armor die > attacker's die: effect die is ignored, armor steps down.
- If your armor die <= attacker's die: attacker's effect die is stepped down by one, armor steps down.

Example (p. 217): Breastplate d8 vs. Iron Spear d6 = Breastplate steps to d6, effect die ignored. Breastplate d8 vs. Iron Spear d8+ = Breastplate steps to d6, effect die stepped down by one.

**Weapon Ranges:** Assign difficulty die to opposition pool based on range appropriateness. If it's "a stretch" = d8 difficulty die added. If "almost impossible" = d12 difficulty die added.

### 3.3 Example Gear

| Gear | Descriptor | SFX |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **Cloaking Device** | Perception | Spend PP: disappear and escape from scene |
| **EMP Blaster** | Electromagnetism | Spend PP: disable any electronic device, including gear |
| **Personal Gravity Generator** | Gravity | Spend PP: hold nearby character in place with gravity field |

| **Tricked-Out Compound Bow** | Graphite Bow | Spend PP: electrically charged arrow (charge on impact); Spend PP: EMP arrow disabling electronics in scene; Spend PP: grappling arrow entangling target; Spend PP: tranquilizer arrow stepping up sleep stress/complication |

All example gear share: **Limit: Gear** (shut down and gain PP; test to restore).

## 4. Fantasy Milestones (pp. 218-219)

Milestones are structured XP triggers at three tiers: 1 XP, 3 XP, and 10 XP. The 10 XP trigger typically forces a binary narrative choice (embrace vs. reject, sacrifice vs. gain). Players select milestones for their characters.

| Milestone | 1 XP | 3 XP | 10 XP |
|-----------|------|------|-------|
| **Accursed** | Your attack demonstrates sinister nature of abilities | Add at least d8 to doom pool (rolling 2+ hitches or using SFX that adds to doom pool) | Finally claimed by villainous power for dark deeds, OR strike major blow against villainous power using their dark powers |
| **Ascetic** | Abstain from worldly pleasure | Participate in indulgence that leads to trouble | Found institution of abstinence, OR abandon ascetic path for one long party |
| **Blessed** | Perform a religious rite | Inflict stress upon a blasphemer | Complete grand work in god's name, OR become martyr for god's cause |
| **Comfortable in the Shadows** | Hide or stay out of spotlight | Leave shadows to accomplish something important | Step into spotlight before large group for something important, OR fade away forever |
| **Haughty Noble** | Say something dismissive about lower class | Try to buy way out of problem/situation | Surrender noble station for adventure, OR give up for life of nobility |
| **Homebody** | Remark that something reminds you of home | Do something adventurous you could never do at home | Retire home and write about adventures, OR embrace adventurous life and admit you can never go home |
| **Honorable Warrior** | State that a decision brings honor or dishonor | Put yourself in position to take stress because alternative would be dishonorable | Perform inexcusable act of dishonor for greater good, OR sacrifice yourself to maintain honor |
| **Leader** | Give order to group member | Group member uses an asset you created for them | Recognized for achievements in great adventure, OR deposed as leader in mutiny |
| **Mysterious Sage** | Make a cryptic observation | Encounter something you can't explain | Exposed as not that wise, OR someone in group is the Chosen One the prophecy spoke of |
| **Nature's Guardian** | Eschew something artificial for natural tool | Create an asset for someone else | Lay down life to protect nature, OR allow nature to be harmed majorly to complete adventure |
| **Planar Traveler** | Follow custom unfamiliar to companions | Tune out of material world endangering companions | Become bound to material world forever, OR depart material world for a new one |
| **Treasure Hunter** | Acquire or spend money | Search for treasure during battle | Find the big score, OR spend all money in act of altruism |

## 5. The Motor Pool (pp. 220-222)

### 5.1 Vehicle Traits

Vehicles have a vehicle file (like a character file) with attributes, distinctions, and signature assets. Vehicle traits can be added to dice pools for tests/contests.

**Vehicle Attributes** (replace team attributes for vehicle-related pools):

| Attribute | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Engines** | Agility and speed; handling quality. Higher = faster and more agile. |
| **Frame** | Structural integrity. Higher = strong and secure. |
| **Systems** | Life support, comms, internet, computers, navigation. Higher = more sophisticated. |
| **Crew** | Skill of GMC crew (PC-operated vehicles don't have this). Higher = trained professionals. |

**Vehicle Distinctions:** Three categories, one from each:
- **Model:** Determines starting attributes and base type. Cannot be swapped.
- **History:** How old/new; current use.
- **Customization:** Modifications/upgrades since build.

Each distinction gets **Hinder: Gain a PP when you switch out this distinction's d8 for a d4** (free SFX). Other SFX can be unlocked. Vehicle distinction SFX use the same benefit/drawback construction as personal distinctions ("reroll a die, step down a complication, earn a PP" balanced by "spend a PP, step up a complication, choose something risky").

A player may add both a vehicle distinction and a personal distinction to a single roll.

**Vehicle Signature Assets:** Represent modifications/resources available on the vehicle. Typically rated d8.

### 5.2 Using Vehicles

**Building Dice Pools:** Pair one PC prime trait with appropriate vehicle trait. Vehicle attributes replace (not add to) PC attributes. Distinctions and signature assets complement/supplement.

**Scale of Success/Failure:** Vehicle success/failure affects the whole group. A single complication (e.g., "Failing Coolant System") affects everyone on board. Avoid laying costs too quickly since one bad roll could knock out the entire group.

**Assets and Complications:** Player-purchased vehicle assets start at d6 and last a scene. Hitches on vehicle tests can be activated by GM as vehicle complications. If a test/contest would take out a vehicle, any PC may spend a PP to take a complication equal to the highest rolling die in the opposing pool to keep the vehicle in the fight.

### 5.3 Building Your Vehicle (p. 222)

**Step 1: Pick a Model.** Assign d8 to each of three attributes (Engines, Frame, Systems). Step up one by up to two steps, but step down another by the same total. Options: d12/d8/d4, d12/d6/d6, d10/d8/d6, or keep all at d8.

**Step 2: Choose 2 More Distinctions.** One history, one customization.

**Step 3: Choose Distinction SFX.** Each gets Hinder for free. Choose two additional SFX to unlock or create.

**Step 4: Choose Signature Assets.** Two at d8. Special features, unique access, or minor GMC/crew.

**Step 5: Name Your Vehicle.**

### 5.4 Training Up Vehicle Resources (p. 221)

Players can spend a session improving vehicle instead of character. Vehicles can swap distinctions (except model), add/step up signature assets, unlock new SFX. PCs can pool session expenditures for vehicle improvements.
