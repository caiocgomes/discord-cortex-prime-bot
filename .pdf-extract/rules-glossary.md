# Cortex Prime RPG - Mechanical Rules Glossary

## Core Resolution Mechanics

**Action** (p. 24, 98)
A mod that replaces tests and contests for dealing with more traditional turn-taking resolution. Actions are rolled first and then opposed by a reaction from the target or a difficulty set by the GM.

**Beat** (p. 88)
The subjective unit of time it takes for a character to carry out a single test and alter or affect the progress of the story.

**Test** (p. 18, 133)
A use of the dice to determine the outcome of an objective or goal, needs to beat the difficulty set by the GM.

**Contest** (p. 19, 133)
A series of dice rolls between opponents, each trying to beat the previous roll until one side chooses not to roll and gives in, or fails to beat the previous roll and takes a complication or is taken out.

**Reaction** (p. 24, 98)
In a contest, the dice roll made by an opponent to beat the acting character's roll. If using the Action Order mod, a reaction serves the same purpose.

## Dice and Results

**Dice** (p. 16-17)
Polyhedral randomizers.

**Dice Pool** (p. 17)

**Hitch** (p. 17)

**Opportunity** (p. 37)
A GM hitch. When the GM rolls a 1 on the dice it gives the players an opportunity to spend a ● Ⓟ to step down a complication or step up an asset. More opportunities mean more steps.

**Botch** (p. 17, 19, 28)
A critical failure. All your dice come up hitches, so your total is zero. The GM can introduce a free ⑥ complication and step it up as many times as you have hitches past the first.

**Effect Die** (p. 20, 159)
A die chosen from the roll that wasn't used for the total, which then gets used for things like creating assets or complications. Usually the largest size die remaining.

A total that's 5 or more points higher than the difficulty set by the opposing roll.

**Beat the Difficulty** (p. 18)
Getting a total that's higher than the difficulty set by the opposition's dice roll.

**Give In** (p. 19, 28)
When called to make a roll, usually in a contest, you instead choose not to roll and accept the consequences on your own terms.

**Taken Out** (p. 19, 21, 22)
